## Data Engineering Journey
- I am currently in the development phase of my ETL/ELT data engineering projects on **batch data** as well as **streaming data** on various domains such as metallurgical, aviation, finance, e-commerce, and digital media.
- I am currently exploring technologies and frameworks such as **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Airflow**, **Apache Spark**, **Big Data**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **AWS** on which my projects are based on.


## 🚀 Projects
### [Project 1: Data engineering project on flight data](https://github.com/vadgamabansari/airlines-data-engineering)
- The ETL pipelines in this project are built using tools and technologies like **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Airflow**, **Apache Cassandra**, and **Docker** in **Python** programming language.

### [Project 2: Data engineering project on Spotify data](https://github.com/vadgamabansari/aws-spotify-insights-data-pipeline)
- The ETL pipeline in this project is built using **AWS** services like **Lambda**, **Glue**, as well as **S3**, along with **Snowflake** and **Python** programming language.
- This project is launching soon.
